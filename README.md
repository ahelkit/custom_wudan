custom_wudan
============

Trying out the new blogging platform, [Ghost](https://ghost.org/). 

I started my design off using the [Wudan Ghost theme](http://www.polygonix.com/ghost-themes/wudan-theme-for-ghost/) as a base and then customized it from there.

So far, I made the blog wider, changed up the design of the posts, added a sidebar, and changed up the icons and fonts. I used the [IcoMoon App](http://icomoon.io/#app-features) to select the vector icons I wanted to use. I used [Sanchez](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Sanchez) as my header font and [Open Sans](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans) as my body font. And the animation on my instagram photos as well as other cool animations can be found at [codrops](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2012/08/08/circle-hover-effects-with-css-transitions/). I added a search to my blog using [Tapir](http://www.metacotta.com/introducing-tapirus/) and used [Disqus](http://blog.christophvoigt.com/enable-comments-on-ghost-with-disqus/) for my comments. It is mobile-friendly! Next is to continually improve the experience and blog!
